## Stranger Things Season 5
*Stranger Things Season 5 might premiere as early as 2024.*

*However, we may still have some time to wait. While production was set to begin in June 2023, it was halted owing to the WGA strike. While that strike has ended, the SAG-AFTRA strike is still going on.*

*We also don't know what kind of distribution model the upcoming season will use. Seasons 1–3 were all released in one volume, whereas Season 4 was split into two volumes, with Volume 1 including seven episodes and Volume 2 containing two.*

*We'll have to wait and see if Season 5 continues with this new split model.*
